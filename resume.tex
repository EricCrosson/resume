\textbf{Extra Curricular Activities} \\
Founded FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team 3529, mentored
FTC, FLL, Jr. FLL teams from 2009-2012 \\

\textbf{Computer Science UIL / Independent Study} \\
Founded the competitive University Interscholastic League computer
science team in high school, where I educated my team in essential
concepts for Java, C/C++, Perl, HTML. Also knowledgeable in
Emacs/Common LISP, Ruby, Octave, BASH and assembly/C for
more than a couple microcontrollers \\

\textbf{GNU/Linux afficionado, Emacs appreciator} \\
During my free time I keep multiple servers in tip top shape with my
favorite minimalist GNU/Linux distribution. Keeping systems
efficient, small, and simple is a passion manifested in Arch. I'm also
over two years deep into Emacs.
